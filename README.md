## developer mindset summary

The fundamental laws of software:

* Keep your software as simple as possible,Consistency is a big part of simplicity.

* Protect it from being an unmanageable and complex system.

-The Purpose of Software is to help peple so bad software is A complex system that doesn’t help people that much.

-The most important goals of the software design are the design should be easy for you to create and maintained, and helpful for others.a bad design software's lifetime will be short.

-Misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.

-If other developers who read your code can understand it easily it means that you are doing good.consider Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand.

-you shouldnot expand your software purpose for no reason,to avoid create complexity.

### All changes require maintenance

The future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

**Change priorities rule** :*The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.*

### Solving Problems steps
* First step is understanding the problem.
* Second step is planning take your time to analyze the problem and process the information.
* Third step is dividing ,Divide the problem into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one.

### chasing perfection

This is a bad thing that causes many problems such as:
* You will be writing code that isn’t needed
* You will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes and dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity.
* You will be missing deadlines.

*Start small, improve it, then extend.*

### Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn’t needed.
* *Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.*

-Dont design based on assumption Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

***Don’t reinvent the wheel.***

### Resistance
* Reject any changes that don't match to your software purpose and your priorities.

-*If you can automate tasks, automate it,Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks.*

-When The software contains a huge number of lines of code that is mean there is something wrong with the design.

-When you test your code, you must execute all new lines at least once and you should start to test parts before the whole.so you can find the bugs and reproduce it.

-Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.Refactoring should be the first option.


### Commenting 
* When you can’t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity to other programmers.The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing.
